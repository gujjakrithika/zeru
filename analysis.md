Behavior Insights by Score Range

0–100: **Risky or inactive wallets**
- May have borrowed without repaying
- Possibly liquidated or abandoned
- Low number of total transactions

100–150: **Average behavior**
- Some borrowing and repayments
- Mixed behavior with a low liquidation rate
- Slightly more engagement than lower brackets

200+: **Highly reliable**
- Strong deposit activity
- High repay-to-borrow ratios

Observations

- Many wallets have **narrow behavioral footprints**, leading to clustered scoring
- Wallets that **interact more broadly and repay debts** are rewarded with higher scores

Conclusion:
This scoring system provides a first-pass way to evaluate wallet risk based on Aave V2 data. While most wallets fall in the lower range, those with consistent, reliable behavior stand out and score significantly higher.
